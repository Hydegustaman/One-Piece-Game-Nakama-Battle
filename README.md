ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hydegustaman
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and coding, well all sort of tech things too.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (combined).
ðŸ“« If happens when you find my codes has an error, or lack of creativity, or maybe has similarity with someone else's code feel free to email me at eggustaman1981@outlook.com I'll be happy to respons it.
 ...

Now, about this project. 

I call it # One-Piece-Game-Nakama-Battle #
One Piece, the most popular on-going anime on the world after Dragon Ball, now come to the GitHub...!
Honestly, the idea comes from a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in JavaScript. Only added few CSS element to it.
Basic play : choose between Luffy, Zoro and Nami as your hand-pick, in this case as your fighter/petarung (Indonesian), 
the computer will automatically pick other fighter, and the battle result will be shown in instance.
If you a fan of One Piece, you might already know that Luffy is stronger than Zoro, but weaker than Nami... lol :D

Have A Nice Day!!
